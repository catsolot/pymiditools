# Py MIDI Tools


This project is an attempt to create a library that makes dealing with MIDI files easy to do with python.

# Usage


Import the pymiditools package to use the methods. So far the only methods support are methods to read in MIDI files, write MIDI files, and to see what kind of instruments are being used in a MIDI file.
